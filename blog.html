      <h3 class="blog-post-1-title">All Thirteen</h3>
      <p class="blog-post-1"> Our January Book Club read was <em>All Thirteen: The Incredible Cave Rescue of the Thai Boys' Soccer Team</em> by Christina Soontornvat. This narrative non-fiction book tells the story of of a group of twelve young boys and their soccer coach who became trapped in a cave in northern Thailand in June of 2018. The book documents the rescue efforts with first-hand accounts from those involved in the rescue efforts and the boys and their coach. After discussing the book, we watched the National Geographic documentary film "The Rescue" (available to watch on Disney+), which documents the 18-day rescue. We loved the book and the film. It was amazing to see how people from around the world came together to find a way to keep these sweet boys alive and successfully remove them from the cave where they had been trapped. While we watched the movie, we enjoyed some delicious chocolate chunk cookies.

      <h3 class="blog-post-2-title">Online Book Resources</h3>
      <p class="blog-post-2">
      All of the books we choose for our book club are available to read for free through online library apps. Many are available in both an e-book and audio-book format. There's also always the option to borrow a hard copy through one of our local libraries. There are two main apps we use - Hoopla and Libby. Both apps are available to download for free through the Google and Apple appstores. Once you download the app, it will require you to enter your local library card number to set up an account. Once your account is set up, you can borrow books, set holds, and create a wish list. Sometimes books will be available on both apps, but many times a book will only be available on one or the other, so we find it helpful to use both.</p>
      <p class="blog-post-2b">In our book club, we strive to choose books that are uplifting and don't contain excessive vulgar language, violence, or explicit scenes. This can be difficult! We often choose a book that one of us has read before in order to avoid the awkward "Ummm I think we might need to choose a different book" texts when one of us comes across unexpected content in a book that was recommended to us. Books don't come with ratings like movies, so it can be hard to know which books will meet our standards. There are a few resources that we've come across that can be helpful - <a href="https://www.compassbookratings.com/" target="_blank">compassbookratings.com</a>, <a href="https://www.ratedreads.com/" target="_blank">ratedreads.com</a>, <a href="https://www.novelbookratings.com/" target="_blank">novelbookratings.com</a> all provide ratings that focus on content. Not all books are listed, but this can be a good place to start.
